<h2>The Beginner's Basics to User Authentication in HapiJS</h2>

I have begun to modify this original adaptation of Web Dev Simplified's Tutorial on ExpressJS Authentication which I simply adjusted to use HapiJS.  After going through WittCode's Youtube Tutorial Series on HapiJS, I have made some very small adjustments to create a Create User Screen.  This will eventually be  modified to be used as a default server side rendered HTML page that can create a user and log them into a hidden html page.  There are probably more plugins I will need, but as it is it uses only a handful of Node Modules and one Hapi Plugin (@hapi/insert) at this time.

_This repository is a work in progress to help assist me in understanding the basics of authentication._
