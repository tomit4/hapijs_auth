<h2>The Beginner's Basics to User Authentication in HapiJS</h2>

This is a very quick tutorial following of Web Dev Simplified's Youtube tutorial on basic authentication utilizing HapiJS and Bcrypt. It very quickly sets up a HapiJS server and exemplifies the basics of user creation with a Bcrypt Hashed/Salted Password and then exemplifies the essentials of Logging in.

The link for the tutorial can be found <a style=color:#00ae8cff href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud5xKCYQTjM">here.</a>

_This version was adapted to be used with HapiJS (webdevsimplified's version uses ExpressJS). This is meant to eventually translate to a basic authentication page using BCrypt and HapiJS, I have yet to explore the possibilities with Joi, but it is something that I will look into once the basics are set up._
